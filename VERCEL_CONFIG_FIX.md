# Vercel Configuration Fix

This document explains the fix applied to resolve the Vercel configuration error.

## Issue

The error occurred because Vercel's configuration does not allow using both `routes` and `rewrites`/`redirects`/`headers`/`cleanUrls`/`trailingSlash` in the same configuration file.

## Solution

Removed the `routes` property and moved its functionality to the `rewrites` array.

### Before (Incorrect)
```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/build/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/(.*)",
      "destination": "https://your-render-app-url.onrender.com/api/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

### After (Correct)
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/(.*)",
      "destination": "https://your-render-app-url.onrender.com/api/$1"
    },
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/build/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Changes Made

1. Removed the `routes` property entirely
2. Added the catch-all rewrite rule `"/(.*)"` → `"/build/index.html"` to the `rewrites` array
3. Kept the API proxy rewrite rule unchanged
4. Preserved all security headers

## Verification

The build process completes successfully with the updated configuration:
```bash
npm run build
# ✓ built in 3.05s
```

## Vercel Configuration Rules

According to Vercel's documentation:
- When using `rewrites`, `redirects`, `headers`, `cleanUrls`, or `trailingSlash`, the `routes` property cannot be present
- All routing functionality should be expressed through the newer properties instead

This fix ensures compliance with Vercel's configuration requirements while maintaining the same functionality.

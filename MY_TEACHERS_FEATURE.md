- Teacher contact information (email)

### 2. **Teacher Selection**

- 📝 Assignments
- 🏆 Grades
- 💬 Discussion

## How It Works

### Data Filtering Logic

1. **Get Student's Enrolled Courses**
   ```typescript
   const enrolledCourses = getStudentCourses(userEmail);
   ```

2. **Extract Unique Teachers**
   - From enrolled courses, get all unique teachers
   - Filter duplicates (same teacher teaching multiple courses)

3. **Teacher Selection**
   - When teacher is selected, filter courses and assignments
   - Show only courses the student is enrolled in
   - Show only assignments from those courses

### Example Scenario

**Student: john.doe@student.aarambh.edu**

**Enrolled Courses:**
- AI & Machine Learning (Dr. Sarah Chen)
- Web Development (Prof. Michael Ross)

```

## Technical Implementation

### Component Props
```typescript
interface MyTeachersPageProps {
  onNavigate: (page: Page) => void;
  userEmail: string; // Used to filter student's data
}
```

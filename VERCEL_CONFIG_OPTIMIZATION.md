# Vercel Configuration Optimization

This document explains the optimization made to the Vercel configuration to remove deprecated properties and improve deployment efficiency.

## Issue

The Vercel build logs showed a warning:
```
WARN! Due to `builds` existing in your configuration file, the Build and Development Settings defined in your Project Settings will not apply.
```

This indicates that the configuration was using legacy `builds` property which prevents Vercel from applying modern project settings.

## Solution

Removed the legacy `builds` property and kept only the modern deployment configuration properties.

### Before (Legacy Configuration)
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/node",
      "config": {
        "includeFiles": ["build/**"]
      }
    }
  ],
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "build",
  // ... other properties
}
```

### After (Modern Configuration)
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "build",
  "framework": null,
  // ... other properties without builds
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates Warning**: Removes the deprecation warning from Vercel builds
2. **Enables Project Settings**: Allows Vercel to apply Build and Development Settings from the dashboard
3. **Modern Configuration**: Uses current Vercel configuration standards
4. **Better Integration**: Works better with Vercel's automatic detection and optimization

## Vercel Configuration Best Practices

1. **Avoid Legacy Properties**: Don't use `builds`, `routes` (use `rewrites` instead)
2. **Use Modern Properties**: `buildCommand`, `outputDirectory`, `framework`, etc.
3. **Leverage Auto-Detection**: Let Vercel detect framework and settings when possible
4. **Keep Configuration Minimal**: Only specify properties that differ from defaults

## Verification

The configuration change maintains all functionality while eliminating the warning:
- Build command remains: `npm run build`
- Output directory remains: `build`
- All rewrites and headers are preserved
- API proxy functionality is unchanged

This optimization ensures your Vercel deployment follows current best practices.

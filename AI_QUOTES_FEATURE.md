# AI-Powered Motivational Quotes Feature

## Overview
The Student and Teacher Dashboards now feature **AI-generated motivational quotes** that refresh each time a user logs in, providing personalized, inspiring messages to enhance the learning experience.

## Features

### ✨ What's New
- **Dynamic AI Quotes**: Each login generates a unique, personalized motivational quote
- **Smart Caching**: Quotes are cached for the session to avoid redundant API calls
- **Graceful Fallback**: If AI service is unavailable, falls back to curated static quotes
- **Visual Feedback**: Shimmer animation shows when a quote is being generated
- **Role-Specific**: Different prompts for students vs. teachers

### 🎯 How It Works

1. **On Login**: When a user logs into their dashboard, the system automatically generates a personalized quote
2. **Personalization**: Uses the user's name (if available) to make the quote more personal
3. **Caching**: The quote is cached for 1 hour to prevent excessive API calls
4. **Display**: Shows with a bot icon (🤖) to indicate AI-generation

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### AI Service (`src/services/ai.service.ts`)
- Uses **Hugging Face's free inference API** (Mistral-7B model)
- Alternative support for **OpenAI API** (GPT-3.5-turbo)
- Implements intelligent caching using session storage
- Falls back to curated quotes if AI is unavailable

#### Dashboard Integration
- **Student Dashboard**: `generateStudentQuote(userName)`
- **Teacher Dashboard**: `generateTeacherQuote(userName)`
- React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) manage quote state
- Loading state with shimmer animation for better UX

### 📝 Configuration

#### Using Hugging Face (Free - Recommended)

1. Get a free API key from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
2. Add to your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   VITE_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=hf_your_api_key_here
   ```

#### Using OpenAI (Optional)

If you prefer OpenAI:
1. Get an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Add to your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_api_key_here
   ```

### 🎨 UI Features

- **Bot Icon**: Indicates AI-generated content
- **Shimmer Effect**: Visual feedback during loading
- **Gradient Card**: Beautiful pink gradient matching app theme
- **Responsive**: Works perfectly on all screen sizes

### 🔒 Privacy & Performance

- **Session-Based Caching**: Quotes cached only for current session
- **No Personal Data**: Only user's first name is used (optional)
- **Rate Limiting**: Automatic caching prevents API abuse
- **Offline Support**: Falls back to static quotes if offline

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Quote not updating?**

- Check API service status

**Loading too slow?**

### 💡 Tips

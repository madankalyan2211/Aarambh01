- `src/services/api.service.ts` - Enhanced API error handling and validation
- `src/config/env.ts` - Improved environment variable loading and validation
- `src/main.tsx` - Added startup validation
- `deploy-frontend.sh` - Updated deployment script with explicit environment variables

### 2. Configuration Files
- `.gitignore` - Added security improvements
- `.env.amplify` - Cleaned sensitive credentials

### 3. Documentation Files
- `API_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Comprehensive documentation of all changes
- `0001-Fix-API-connection-issues-in-production-deployment.patch` - Git patch file with all changes

### 4. Deployment Package
- `aarambh-frontend-deploy.zip` - Final deployment package with all fixes

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced API Service
- Added validation to detect when API base URL is not properly configured
- Added better error handling for cases where the frontend receives HTML instead of JSON
- Added explicit checks in all API functions to prevent requests when API is misconfigured
- Added logging for debugging API configuration issues

### 2. Improved Environment Configuration
- Added logging to verify environment variables are loaded correctly
- Added validation for production environments to ensure API base URL is properly set
- Fixed TypeScript errors in environment variable access

### 3. Startup Validation
- Added checks at application startup to verify API configuration
- Added warnings/errors for misconfigured environments

### 4. Security Improvements
- Added `.env.amplify` to `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive credentials
- Cleaned sensitive credentials from `.env.amplify` file

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Configure Environment Variables in AWS Amplify Console (Recommended)
1. Go to your Amplify app settings
2. Navigate to "Environment variables"
3. Add `VITE_API_BASE_URL` with value `https://aarambh-production.eba-hmkpyyve.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/api`

### Option 2: Use the Updated Deployment Script
1. Run `./deploy-frontend.sh` which explicitly sets environment variables during build

### Option 3: Manual Deployment
1. Upload the `aarambh-frontend-deploy.zip` file to AWS Amplify

## Verification
After deployment, the frontend should:
- Properly use the configured backend API URL
- Make API requests to `https://aarambh-production.eba-hmkpyyve.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/api/auth/login/`
- Display better error messages if API configuration issues occur

## Applying These Changes to Your Repository
If you have your own fork of the repository, you can apply these changes using the patch file:
```bash
git apply 0001-Fix-API-connection-issues-in-production-deployment.patch
```

Or manually copy the changes from the files in this package to your repository.

# Aarambh LMS Deployment Summary

This document summarizes all the work done to prepare the Aarambh Learning Management System for deployment to Render (backend) and Vercel (frontend).

## üìã Overview

The deployment process involves:
1. **Backend deployment** to Render (Node.js/Express application)
2. **Frontend deployment** to Vercel (React/Vite application)
3. **Environment configuration** for both platforms
4. **Integration testing** to ensure proper communication

## üìÅ Files Created

### Backend Configuration (Render)
- [server/render.yaml](server/render.yaml) - Render service configuration
- [server/.env.production](server/.env.production) - Production environment variables
- [server/build.sh](server/build.sh) - Build script for Render
- [server/start-server.sh](server/start-server.sh) - Production startup script
- [server/health.js](server/health.js) - Enhanced health check endpoint

### Frontend Configuration (Vercel)
- [vercel.json](vercel.json) - Vercel configuration file
- [.env.production](.env.production) - Production environment variables
- [build.sh](build.sh) - Build script for Vercel

### Documentation & Helpers
- [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) - Comprehensive deployment instructions
- [DEPLOYMENT_FILES_SUMMARY.md](DEPLOYMENT_FILES_SUMMARY.md) - Summary of all deployment files
- [DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md](DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md) - Step-by-step deployment checklist
- [check-deployment-files.js](check-deployment-files.js) - Script to verify deployment files
- [setup-env.js](setup-env.js) - Environment variables setup helper

### Modified Files
- [server/server.js](server/server.js) - Enhanced health check endpoint
- [server/package.json](server/package.json) - Added production start script
- [README.md](README.md) - Added deployment section

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Details

### Backend Environment Variables (Render)
Key variables that need to be configured:
- `MONGODB_URI` - MongoDB connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secret for JWT token signing
- `GMAIL_USER` and `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` - For email sending
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` - CORS configuration (update after frontend deployment)
- `API_SECRET_KEY` - For API security
- AI API keys (optional): `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`

### Frontend Environment Variables (Vercel)
Key variables that need to be configured:
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` - Backend API URL (update after backend deployment)
- `VITE_APP_ENV` - Set to `production`
- `VITE_DEBUG_MODE` - Set to `false`

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### Phase 1: Preparation
1. Verify all deployment files exist using `node check-deployment-files.js`
2. Plan environment variables using `node setup-env.js`
3. Review [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) and [DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md](DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md)

### Phase 2: Backend Deployment (Render)
1. Connect Git repository to Render
2. Create Web Service with proper configuration
3. Set environment variables in Render dashboard
4. Deploy and note the application URL

### Phase 3: Frontend Deployment (Vercel)
1. Update [.env.production](.env.production) with backend URL
2. Connect Git repository to Vercel
3. Configure project settings (Vite framework, build commands)
4. Deploy and note the application URL

### Phase 4: Integration
1. Update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in Render with Vercel app URL
2. Redeploy backend to apply CORS changes
3. Test end-to-end functionality

## üß™ Testing

### Automated Verification
- Run `node check-deployment-files.js` to verify all files are present

### Manual Testing
- [DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md](DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md) includes comprehensive testing steps
- Verify health endpoints on both platforms
- Test user registration and login flows
- Check course enrollment and assignment submission
- Validate email functionality

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

1. All sensitive information is stored as environment variables in platform dashboards
2. No secrets are committed to version control
3. CORS is properly configured to allow only trusted origins
4. HTTPS is enforced on both platforms
5. MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist should include Render's IP addresses

## üÜò Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions are documented in:
- [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) - Troubleshooting section
- [DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md](DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md) - Common issues list

## ‚úÖ Status

All deployment files and configurations have been created and verified. The application is ready for deployment to Render and Vercel following the instructions in the deployment guide and checklist.

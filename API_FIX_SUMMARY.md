# API Connection Fix Summary

## Problem
The frontend application was making API requests to the Amplify app URL (`https://main.dr5r9xxdzd1cq.amplifyapp.com/api/auth/login/`) instead of the configured backend API URL, resulting in 404 errors.

## Root Cause
1. Environment variables were not being properly loaded in the AWS Amplify deployment
2. The frontend was falling back to relative URLs (`/api/*`) which were being served by the frontend app itself
3. No validation was in place to detect misconfigured API connections

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced API Service (`src/services/api.service.ts`)
- Added validation to detect when API base URL is not properly configured
- Added better error handling for cases where the frontend receives HTML instead of JSON
- Added explicit checks in all API functions to prevent requests when API is misconfigured
- Added logging for debugging API configuration issues

### 2. Improved Environment Configuration (`src/config/env.ts`)
- Added logging to verify environment variables are loaded correctly
- Added validation for production environments to ensure API base URL is properly set
- Fixed TypeScript errors in environment variable access

### 3. Added Startup Validation (`src/main.tsx`)
- Added checks at application startup to verify API configuration
- Added warnings/errors for misconfigured environments

### 4. Updated Deployment Script (`deploy-frontend.sh`)
- Added explicit environment variables during build process
- Made deployment process more robust

### 5. Security Improvements (`.gitignore`)
- Added `.env.amplify` to `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive credentials

## Files Modified
1. `src/services/api.service.ts` - Enhanced API error handling and validation
2. `src/config/env.ts` - Improved environment variable loading and validation
3. `src/main.tsx` - Added startup validation
4. `deploy-frontend.sh` - Updated deployment script with explicit environment variables
5. `.gitignore` - Added security improvements
6. `.env.amplify` - Cleaned sensitive credentials

## How to Deploy
1. **Option 1 (Recommended)**: Configure environment variables in AWS Amplify Console:
   - Go to your Amplify app settings
   - Navigate to "Environment variables"
   - Add `VITE_API_BASE_URL` with value `https://aarambh-production.eba-hmkpyyve.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/api`

2. **Option 2**: Use the updated deployment script:
   - Run `./deploy-frontend.sh` which explicitly sets environment variables during build

3. **Option 3**: Ensure `.env.production` file is properly loaded during Amplify build process

## Verification
After deployment, the frontend should:
- Properly use the configured backend API URL
- Make API requests to `https://aarambh-production.eba-hmkpyyve.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/api/auth/login/`
- Display better error messages if API configuration issues occur

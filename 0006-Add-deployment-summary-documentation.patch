+# Aarambh LMS API Connection Fix - Deployment Summary
+
+## Overview
+This document summarizes all the changes made to fix the API connection issues in the Aarambh LMS application when deployed to AWS Amplify.
+
+## Files Modified
+
+### 1. Source Code Files
+- `src/services/api.service.ts` - Enhanced API error handling and validation
+- `src/config/env.ts` - Improved environment variable loading and validation
+- `src/main.tsx` - Added startup validation
+- `deploy-frontend.sh` - Updated deployment script with explicit environment variables
+
+### 2. Configuration Files
+- `.gitignore` - Added security improvements
+- `.env.amplify` - Cleaned sensitive credentials
+
+### 3. Documentation Files
+- `API_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Comprehensive documentation of all changes
+- `0001-Fix-API-connection-issues-in-production-deployment.patch` - Git patch file with all changes
+
+### 4. Deployment Package
+- `aarambh-frontend-deploy.zip` - Final deployment package with all fixes
+
+## Key Improvements
+
+### 1. Enhanced API Service
+- Added validation to detect when API base URL is not properly configured
+- Added better error handling for cases where the frontend receives HTML instead of JSON
+- Added explicit checks in all API functions to prevent requests when API is misconfigured
+- Added logging for debugging API configuration issues
+
+### 2. Improved Environment Configuration
+- Added logging to verify environment variables are loaded correctly
+- Added validation for production environments to ensure API base URL is properly set
+- Fixed TypeScript errors in environment variable access
+
+### 3. Startup Validation
+- Added checks at application startup to verify API configuration
+- Added warnings/errors for misconfigured environments
+
+### 4. Security Improvements
+- Added `.env.amplify` to `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive credentials
+- Cleaned sensitive credentials from `.env.amplify` file
+
+## Deployment Instructions
+
+### Option 1: Configure Environment Variables in AWS Amplify Console (Recommended)
+1. Go to your Amplify app settings
+2. Navigate to "Environment variables"
+3. Add `VITE_API_BASE_URL` with value `https://aarambh-production.eba-hmkpyyve.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/api`
+
+### Option 2: Use the Updated Deployment Script
+1. Run `./deploy-frontend.sh` which explicitly sets environment variables during build
+
+### Option 3: Manual Deployment
+1. Upload the `aarambh-frontend-deploy.zip` file to AWS Amplify
+
+## Verification
+After deployment, the frontend should:
+- Properly use the configured backend API URL
+- Make API requests to `https://aarambh-production.eba-hmkpyyve.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/api/auth/login/`
+- Display better error messages if API configuration issues occur
+

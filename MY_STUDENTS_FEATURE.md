# My Students Feature (Teachers)

## Overview
The "My Students" page allows teachers to view all their class sections (courses), see enrolled students in each section, and manage assignments for those students.

## Features

### 1. **Statistics Dashboard**
At the top of the page, teachers see:
- **Total Students**: Total number of students across all courses
- **Class Sections**: Number of courses they teach
- **Active Assignments**: Total assignments created
- **Average per Section**: Average students per course

### 2. **Class Sections List** (Left Panel)
- View all courses taught by the teacher
- Each card shows:
  - Course name and description
  - Number of enrolled students
  - Number of assignments
- Click to select a section
- Visual indicator (checkmark) for selected course
- **Pink border** highlights selected course

### 3. **Section Details Panel** (Right Panel)
When a class section is selected, teachers can see:

#### **Course Information Card**
- Course name and full description
- Total enrolled students in this section
- Total assignments for this course

#### **Enrolled Students Section**
- Grid view of all students in this section
- Each student card shows:
  - Student name
  - Email address
  - Total courses they're enrolled in
- "View Grades" button to navigate to grades page

#### **Course Assignments Section**
- All assignments created for this course
- Each assignment shows:
  - Assignment title and description
  - Due date and posted date
  - Urgency indicator
  - Number of students assigned
- "Manage Assignments" button to create/edit assignments
- "Create Assignment" button if no assignments exist

## Navigation

The "My Students" tab is now available in the teacher navigation bar:
- 🏠 Dashboard
- 👨‍🎓 **My Students** ← NEW!
- 📚 Courses
- 📝 Assignments
- 🏆 Grades
- 💬 Discussion

## How It Works

### Data Filtering Logic

1. **Get Teacher's Courses**
   ```typescript
   const teacherCourses = courses.filter(course => 
     // Match teacher by email
   );
   ```

2. **Get Teacher's Students**
   ```typescript
   const teacherStudents = getTeacherStudents(userEmail);
   ```
   - Returns all students enrolled in ANY of the teacher's courses

3. **Course Selection**
   - When a course is selected, filter students by that course
   - Show only students enrolled in the selected course
   - Show assignments for that specific course
